## Apples 🍎 🍏
I've scraped apple data from **www.orangepippin.com** and extracted characteristics like year introduced, cropping and keeping ability, uses, and picking season.

The characteristic I'm most interested in is **picking season** because it allows me to organize my site and plant apples according to when they will produce. 

Could be very helpful in designing a U-pick orchard, or just for homestead design. 

Simply pass your apple varieties to **apples_scraper.py** in text file called **my_apples.txt**.
