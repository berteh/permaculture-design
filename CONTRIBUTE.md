## UI and graphics

UI discussions happen at [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/szax2i8/pfszbl1), [ðŸ—ª give us a shout](https://github.com/jwnigel/permaculture/issues/new/choose) to explain how you want to join and get access.

Graphics assets are more than welcome, preferably in opensource format (Inkscape's SVG, Gimp's rasterized).

And if you wanna share some great music or your own design for the world to get some inspiration you're welcome too.
