# Permaculture plant scraping and UI design :chestnut: :seedling: :deciduous_tree:

## I've divided this project into two parts:
### Part 1 - Scraping and cleaning :ledger: :pencil2:
I scraped data from pfaf.org and extracted about 20 characteristics for each plant
Characteristics include height, width, growth rate, leaf and flower dates, soil and pH preferences, etc.
The input is all_plants.txt, which is passed to main.py, and saves a .csv file
You can fork a copy and modifify the .txt file to include the plants you wish to include

### Part 2 - UI permaculture design application :art: :paintbrush:
In progress... I want to use the plant database to create an interactive design application
I want to be able to drag and drop plants from a list to an arial photo and arrange them.
