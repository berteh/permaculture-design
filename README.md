# Permaculture designer tool

Ever dreamed of designing your permaculture project with ease ? This tool will allow you to access inspiration from established *botanical databases*, easily *lay out* your favorite plants in a way that considers their ecological functions and the synergy of the whole. Then with a click you can break down your design into an organized guide with plant totals and row-by-row layouts. Then export it, either for the world... or just for friends to go plant together !

## Features

This tool can be used for any garden, orchard, or homestead design project, not restricted to permaculture. But we will focus on permaculture design, supporting the integration of plants', people's and animals' needs in the design. :bug: :fallen_leaf:

For instance considering the reference **harvest or picking** period allows you to organize your site, and plant apple trees according to when they should produce... most helpful in designing a U-pick orchard, or just for homestead design. Likewise with **flowering** periods, either to ensure that the food crops in your design will have a pollinator partner, or to use in combination with **pollinators** to ensure a constant supply of food for our pollinator friends. :honeybee: :beetle:

This tool will also allow you to take into account plant growth rate, uses, preferences like soils, moisture, shade and pH, allowing you to design as thoroughly as possible. :deciduous_tree: :partly_sunny: 
 
When your design is complete you can generate detailed planting maps and guides, helping you bring your design to life. :rainbow: :seedling:

### Data Reuse

Our scapers gather [useful botanical](sample/sven_plants.csv) information from a [plain list](sample/sven_plants.txt) of plants.

Some scrapers (see [code/scrapers](scrapers/)) to gather data from good (permaculture and classical) botanical sources, including
- [x] https://pfaf.org, collecting a.o. plants height, width, growth rate, leaf and flower dates, soil and pH preferences)
- [x] https://permapeople.org plants database (and its many filters)
- [x] üçé data from https://orangepippin.com, with year introduced, cropping and keeping ability, uses, and picking season.
- [ ] üçè https://pomiferous.com for an even larger apple database (over 7,000 varieties)

Help us integrate more relevant sources and curating these data, [join the fun here](https://github.com/users/jwnigel/projects/1/views/1?layout=board&pane=issue&itemId=19329892).

We still need to consider proper linking/referencing to these original materials.

### permaculture designer UI

Some UI sketches for a permaculture designer interface are being drafted... get in touch if you want to help. It will allow you to drag and drop plants from a list to an arial photo and arrange them.
